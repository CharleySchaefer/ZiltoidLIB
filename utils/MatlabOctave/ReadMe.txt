  Scripts are compatible with Matlab, but  
  were tested in GNU Octave:

    GNU Octave, version 3.8.2
    Octave was configured for "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu".

  DESCRIPTION
-----------------
  bisection:
        > Bisection method to find a value, or the 
          closest values to that, in an array.
        > demo_bisection() is provided.
  detectClusters:
        > nodes are connected to neighbouring nodes;
          based on the connectivity information the clusters
          of nodes are identified
  integer_partitions:
        > an integer can be partitioned, e.g., 
          4=1+1+1+1, 4=2+1+1, etc.. This function determines
          all possible partitions.
  SEM:  > Sampling a probability distribution
        > Calculating a standard error to determine 
          how well the distribution is sampled
