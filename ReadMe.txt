ZiltoidLIB
----------
Selection of functions that are commonly encoutered in C programs for physical modelling and simulation.

The functionality involves:
> Reading files
> Interpretation of strings
> Generating random numbers
> Mathematical methods

The functions were initially (since 2011) developed in simple programs to prevent the requirement of external libraries: Most are not optimised for performance.
